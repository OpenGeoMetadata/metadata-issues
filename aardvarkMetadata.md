| Entry Guidelines      | Titles should include place names and dates when available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Commentary            | The title is the most prominent metadata field that users see when browsing or scanning search results. Since many datasets are created with ambiguous or non-unique titles, it may be worth the effort to improve or enhance them. The ideal sequence of a title is something akin to Topic of Layer: Place, Year. Putting the year at the end of a title produces better search results, since titles are left-anchored. |

| Commentary            | For discoverability, improving titles for data is encouraged. The Alternative Title field could be a place to keep the original title. It could also be useful for scanned maps. Some have long titles that include MARC subtitle fields, such as 245$b. Whether or not Alternative Title should appear in your GeoBlacklight item view pages can be customized in the application. |

| Entry Guidelines      | At minimum, this is a reiteration of the title in sentence format. Other relevant information, such as data creation methods, data sources, and special licenses, may also be included. Description is a plain text field by default.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Commentary            | The Description field is the second most prominent value (after Title) that users see when search or browsing for items. Although not required, it is strongly recommended. If the description is minimal or lacking, it can be improved by concatenating available metadata fields, such as title, date, format, and place. This is a plain text field, so html code is not supported here unless the application is customized. |
